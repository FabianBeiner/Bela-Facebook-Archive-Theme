# Bela ― An alternative style for your “Facebook Archive”

## How do I use Bela?

This CSS file replaces the original file from [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook).

**Simply overwrite the existing `style.css` (located in the `html` folder) with the new version from `dist`. That’s it!**

If you don’t know how to get to your personal archive, make  sure to check the following link: [https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644](https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644)

## Why have you created this?

My mom read an article about Facebook and the issue of data protection. She asked me if I can show her what Facebook knows about her. When I showed her the data, she said: **“That’s ugly and confusing. Make it nice and come back, sweetie.”**

*Oh well, mom, here you go!* <3

## Postscript

I invested only about an hour into this thing. It’s not optimized and tested only in Chrome.

Thanks for stopping by! ―[Fabian](https://fabianbeiner.de)
