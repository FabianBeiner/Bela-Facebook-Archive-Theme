# Bela – an alternative theme for your “Facebook Archive”

**This CSS file is a replacement for the one provided by Facebook. Just replace the existing `style.css` (located in the `html` folder of your Facebook archive) with the one from the `dist` directory and you’re good to go.**

No idea how to get your archive? Please read [“How can I download my information from Facebook?”]( https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644).

## Why?!

My mom asked me about the data Facebook stores about here. I showed her the archive. She said: ***“Ughh, that’s ugly. Make it beautiful and come back, honey”***.

*Well, mom, here you go.* <3
